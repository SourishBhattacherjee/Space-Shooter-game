Space Shooter Game

This is a simple space shooter game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and shoots bullets to destroy incoming enemy spaceships. The objective is to survive as long as possible while earning points by destroying enemy ships.

### How to Play

1. Controls:
   - Use the left and right arrow keys to move the spaceship horizontally.
   - Press the up arrow key or the spacebar to shoot bullets.

2. Objective:
   - Destroy as many enemy spaceships as possible to earn points.
   - Avoid collision with the enemy ships. If an enemy ship reaches the bottom of the screen, the game ends.

### Files

- index.html: Contains the structure of the game layout and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
  
- style.css: Defines the styles for the game elements including the background, spaceship, bullets, and enemy ships.

- index.js: Implements the game logic including player movement, bullet shooting, enemy ship generation, and collision detection.

### Game Mechanics

- Player Movement:
  - The player can move the spaceship left and right within the game board.
  
- Shooting Bullets:
  - Bullets are fired upwards from the spaceship when the player presses the up arrow key or the spacebar.
  - Bullets move vertically upwards until they either collide with an enemy ship or reach the top of the game board.

- Enemy Ship Generation:
  - Enemy ships are randomly generated at the top of the game board and move downwards towards the player's spaceship.
  
- Collision Detection:
  - When a bullet collides with an enemy ship, both the bullet and the ship are destroyed, and the player earns points.

- Game Over:
  - The game ends when an enemy ship reaches the bottom of the game board, indicating a collision with the player's spaceship.
  - The player can then reload the page to restart the game.
